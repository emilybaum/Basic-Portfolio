What you will find:
1) Some detials about me (in the About section on the About page)

3) A contact form on the Contact page - this form does not currently collect the form inputs, but you can click the submit button to send me an email

What else you will find:
3 Easter Eggs that are hidden throughout the site. If you look in the source code, they will be very obvious to find, but it's way more fun to click around and move around the pages to find them yourself. Good Luck!

HINT 1: there is 1 easter egg hidden on each page
HINT 2: pay attention to very subtle things for 2 of the eggs
