                    <p>Hi there! Some things you should know about me are that I love to travel, am a DIY project aficionado, love IKEA (so much), have spent a few years playing competitive dodgeball, genuinely love helping people, find myself always learning something about something, enjoy a good documentary over many movies, and I am insanely curious about how stuff works. When I find a problem, I can’t rest until I understand what the dealio is, or even better, if I’ve got a solution for it. </p>
                    <p>I believe that there is always a way to solution for anything, even if that is not what you were originally thinking it would be. Here’s to hoping that helps with the coding and then eventually leads me down a very exciting and very technical path. Coding has been one of my bucket list items for the past few years, and I’m so excited to finally be learning!</p>
                    <p>Now that you know a few things about me, do you fancy an Easter egg hunt? Buried in this site are the answers to these three questions:</p>
                    <ol id="easterEggQuestions">
                        <li>What was the make and model of my first and only car?</li>
                            <!-- 2000 Ford Focus, in a nice navy blue – brought me all the way through high school, college, and to New York City. We parted ways in 2012 after a good run. -->
                        <li>What is my perpetual 12-month plan?</li>
                            <!-- To get a dog! One day it will happen – when I live in an apartment that allows pets, I find a ton of extra time, and I have the money to pay for him. I’ve had this “plan” for the past 2 years. -->
                        <li>What church do I attend? </li>
                            <!-- Redeemer LSQ on the Upper West Side! I’ve been going there the past few years and I’m so grateful for my community of friends. Let me know if you want to hear more of my Christian journey. -->
